# Web Car
You can control the car here: hammywebserver.duckdns.org/drive.html

This is a web application to allow control over a Arduino-based, wifi-connected car.

The web app uses TypeScript and Python and operates through WebSockets.

The car was built with an ESP8266 NodeMCU module and put on a 3d-printed chassis, pictured below.
